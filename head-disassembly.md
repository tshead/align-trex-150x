# Head Disassembly

To remove press-fit components, I use standard imperial drill bits and a
parallel wood clamp.  I use smaller bits to press out the feathering shaft, and
larger bits to press the bearings out of the blade holders.  To avoid damaging
the part that you’re pressing, use the largest bit that will clear the
surrounding area.  Note that I use the **base** of the drill bit to apply
pressure, with the tip of the bit against the wood clamp - pressing with the
tip of the bit will almost certainly damage the part you’re pressing.

There is a screw at each end of the feathering shaft that secures the blade
holders.  To remove the screws, you loosen them using two hex drivers
simultaneously on both sides of the shaft.  Inevitably, one screw will loosen
first, leaving the second screw stuck in the shaft.  If you need / want to
remove the second screw from the feathering shaft, a drill chuck can hold the
shaft without scratching its surface.  Of course, if you’re replacing a bent
feathering shaft (the most likely reason to disassemble the head), you don’t
need to remove that screw anyway, the replacements come with their own screws.

Note that when you’re replacing a bent feathering shaft, the bend may make it
difficult to press the shaft through the bearings in the blade holders - it’s
easy to wreck a bearing-or-two, so you should be prepared to replace them.  If
this is your first time, don’t fret about reassembly - a new, unbent feathering
shaft will install easily with just finger pressure.
